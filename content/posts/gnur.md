# tl;dr

I wanted a domain for stuff, gnur.nl was available.

# Why gnur?
About 14 years ago, I really started getting into self-hosting stuff. But without a domain it was getting harder to reach stuff from the outside.

I wanted something easy to type, remember and pronounce (in Dutch, I kind of forgot about the rest of the world..). After testing lots of domains I settled on gnur.nl  
Soon thereafter I started using it as my online nickname as well. I liked the sound of it and people often link it to GNU Linux. Which it has no real connection with but since I work a lot with linux and opensource I don't mind the similarity. 

I've sometimes joked gnur is a recursive acronym like [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/):

> gnur: gnur's not unix, really

# pronounciation

For Dutch speakers, gnur is actually quite easy to pronounce. For English speakers the most important part is that the first `g` is not silent as in `gnome`, but like the `j` in the spanish `Juan`. Coupled with pronouncing the `u` as in `hurd`, you get _gnur_ ;).
