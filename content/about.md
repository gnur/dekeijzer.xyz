## using prometheus for monitoring your power usage at home
In March of 2018 I presented on how to use prometheus with a smart meter at Grafanacon, video is available on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtna51BLYMc&t=8s)

## Running Docker in Production (lessons learned using DC/OS)
In February of 2017, together with Roy Bauweraerts, we presented on the experience of migrating to a Docker based workload.

After running a monolith for several years, Mijndomein migrated to an architecture based on microservices in the beginning of 2016. It was quickly realised that running microservices on dedicated AWS instances wasnâ€™t as agile and efficient as needed. In the summer of 2016 the deadline was set that everything should run in Docker before December. We talk about the challenges that come with running microservices and how we solved them. We also look back and talk about if this whole undertaking was worth it.
