# about Erwin de Keijzer

Erwin is a DevOps Engineer at TrueFullstaq. He loves educating people what it means to build cloud native applications (and it's not just using the "cloud"). Using the Cloud Native landscape to make application delivery and lifecycle simple and reliable. At home he is always looking for sidequests; monitoring his power usage to send notifications when his washing machine is done, connecting the garage door to the internet (securely) and adding music to his elevator are just a few examples. His experience makes him a very practical engineer, finding the simple solution is more important than having a modern, shiny solution.

[dekeijzer.xyz](https://dekeijzer.xyz) is a gathering of ideas, sidequests and a basic approximation of a portfolio / resume.

We told some stories about the cloud native world and how you can cowboy your way around certain restrictions.

## Running Docker in Production (lessons learned using DC/OS)
In February of 2017, together with Roy Bauweraerts, we presented on the experience of migrating to a Docker based workload.

After running a monolith for several years, Mijndomein migrated to an architecture based on microservices in the beginning of 2016. It was quickly realised that running microservices on dedicated AWS instances wasnâ€™t as agile and efficient as needed. In the summer of 2016 the deadline was set that everything should run in Docker before December. We talk about the challenges that come with running microservices and how we solved them. We also look back and talk about if this whole undertaking was worth it.
